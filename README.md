===========

A little game in Elm. The idea is to shoot through the gaps in the platforms as they fly by. In each level you need to reach a certain number of points. Hitting the bottom gains you points, while hitting platforms loses you points.

### What it looks like so far

### To do

* Collision detection
* Scoring (easy after collection detection...maybe?)
* A `PlatformPattern` type for specifying patterns in the generation of platforms, which will make things more interesting than the random pattern shown above
